# HandsBump
## Introduction
**HandsBump, bump hands!**

This game is from a China chlid's game "Bump Finger". It mean fingers bump each other. For a example under:

A hand is one. It bumps other child's hand, this hand is one too, they will merge each. This hand change to two.

Same operation, but one of hands is five, this hand will collapse. When one of children all of hands all collapse, this child will win.

I take this to the program. It's so cool!!!!!

## Features

### Game

I take this to the program, but I add some of changes:
- Players hand counts max can be **2,147,483,647**!!! (P.S. This is C# Int.MaxValue, so limit is this:P)
- Startup from the **Preset**

  Preset
  - Player count
  - Players Option
    
    - Hand Count
    - Target
    - Target Player Number

And some changes of game under.

In the game, if one hand is **Target** of this hand, it will collapse(default **Target** is five). All players has their **Score** and **Point**, when this game is over, them will add to the record and save, it's judges someone indicators of **Wins**.

### UI and Important features

This program has many menus. They are important.

Up, down, left, right arrows are for operate the menu items.

And, save your game records to you computer, you can always see all of your records!

P.S. this program is always resize your console, because this can keep good user experience for UI.
