# HandsBump
## introduction
HandsBump, bump hands!
This game is from a China chlid's game "Bump Finger". It mean fingers bump each other. For a example under:

A hand is one. It bumps other child's hand, this hand is one too, they will merge each. This hand change to two.

Same operater, but one of hands is five, this hand will collapse. When one of children all of hands all collapse, this child will win.


I take this to the program.

## features

This program has many menus. They are important.

↑ ↓ ← → are for operate the menu items. This logic is so complex.
